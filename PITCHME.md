# System Test Automation
## Fundamentals

---

## What is it?
_Automated checking that things that were previously known to be true, still are._

---

## Why do it?
_Properly built and maintained test automation helps you to change with confidence, and so change at speed._

  - Integration testing in the large/small
  - How it relates to API testing
  - Q: What’s the difference between system and acceptance testing?

---

## Fundamental Principles

  - Priorities
      - Stability > Performance > Coverage
  - Measuring health
      - Signal : Noise

---

## Webdriver Overview

  - Selenium webdriver project
    - Spec
    - Bindings
    - Server 
      - Infra
    - Drivers

---

## Design pattern/s

  - Basic 3 layer
    - Test specification 
    - User behavior 
    - System abstraction 

  - Q: What about BDD/Tools?

---

## Workflow
  - Capturing scenarios
  - Building the abstraction
  - Proving code
  - Proving compatibility
  - Proving stability
  - Local execution vs Remote execution

---

## Common pitfalls
  - Degradation
  - Silo’d ownership
  - Over reliance
  - Over engineering

---

## Known Issues
  - Driver immaturity
  - Remote execution performance
  - Notable absences from specification
